# 5G Jamming Detection Dataset (5G_JDD)

This folder contains the 5G communication monitoring indicators that were recorded throughout the project. 

## Available Folders:

1. **`laboratory_data_shieldingobx`**:  
   - The data in the laboratory_data_shieldingobx folder was collected by our project partner HMF and then processed and merged for further analysis. The smartphone was placed in a shielding box and connected to the system with an attenuator via an air interface. 

2. **`merged_data.csv`**:  
   - The data in the real_laboratory_test_field folder was recorded in TU Berlin's own test field at the DAI laboratory. The Smatthone was connected to a 5G indoor unit via 5G and pinged this base station. Speed tests were also carried out to generate some traffics.

## Further Notes:

- All files have been carefully prepared to ensure easy handling and analysis of the 5G communication data.
- The datasets can be utilized for various tasks within 5G communication monitoring and analysis, such as detecting disturbances (e.g., jamming) or modeling network behavior.
