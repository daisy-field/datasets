# 5G Jamming Detection Dataset (5G_JDD)

This folder includes the 5G communication monitoring indicators recorded at the second workshop day.

## Available Data:

1. **`movement_jamming_no_jamming_ping_and_speedtest.csv`**:  
   - In this test, the smartphone was moved around the room. The jammer was active. The Smartphone  constantly pinged the base station. Speed tests were also carried out to check the effects of the jammer.

2. **`no_jamming.csv`**:  
   - In this test, the smartphone was moved around the room. The jammer was inactive. The smartphone constantly pinged the base station. Speed tests were also carried out to verify that the speed remains constant without the jammer.

3. **`no_movement_jamming_ping_and_speedtest.csv`**:  
   - In this test, the smartphone was placed on a table. The jammer was active. The Smartphone  constantly pinged the base station. Speed tests were also carried out to check the effects of the jammer.

4. **`no_movement_no_jamming_con_lost.csv`**:  
   - In this test, the smartphone was placed on a table. The jammer was inactive. The smartphone constantly pinged the base station. Speed tests were also carried out to verify that the speed remains constant without the jammer. However, the smartphone lost the connection to the base station in this test without the jammer being involved.

5. **`no_movement_no_jamming_only_ping.csv`**:  
   - In this test, the smartphone was placed on a table. The jammer was inactive. The smartphone constantly pinged the base station. 

7. **`no_movement_no_jamming_ping_and_speedtest.csv`**:  
   - In this test, the smartphone was placed on a table. The jammer was inactive. The smartphone constantly pinged the base station. 

## Further Notes:

- All files have been carefully prepared to ensure easy handling and analysis of the 5G communication data.
- The dataset can be utilized for various tasks within 5G communication monitoring and analysis, such as detecting disturbances (e.g., jamming) or modeling network behavior.
