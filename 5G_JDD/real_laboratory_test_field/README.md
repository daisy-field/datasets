# 5G Jamming Detection Dataset (5G_JDD)

This folder includes the 5G communication monitoring indicators recorded during a two days workshop in our test field.
## Available Data:

1. **`day_1`**:  
   - Test data from the first day. On this day, the smartphone was placed on a table and the base station was constantly pinging. The jammer was two meters away from the smartphone and interfered with the 5G signal with a power of 12dB.
2. 
2. **`day_2`**:  
   - Test data from the second day. On this day, the system was tested both statically and dynamically. For the dynamic test, the smartphone was moved around the room. The smartphone permanently pinged the base station. Speed tests were also carried out to simulate some load. During the static tests, the jammer was located two meters away from the smartphone and interfered with the 5G signal with a power of 12dB. In the dynamic test, the jammer emitted 24dB of power. The distance was between 4 and 10 meters.

## Further Notes:

- All files have been carefully prepared to ensure easy handling and analysis of the 5G communication data.
- The dataset can be utilized for various tasks within 5G communication monitoring and analysis, such as detecting disturbances (e.g., jamming) or modeling network behavior.
